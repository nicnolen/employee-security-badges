  ## Description

  ## Usage Instructions
  To use this app, type in dotnet run to the CLI. You will then be prompted if you want to enter employee information manually. If you type "yes" you will be asked to put in the employee's first name, last name, id, and picture. If you type "no", you will be prompted with another question that asks if you want to fetch employee data from the API. If you type yes, 10 random employees will be generated.
